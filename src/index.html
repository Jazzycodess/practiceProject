            Software development is the process programmers use to build computer programs. The process, also known as the
            Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), includes several phases that provide a method for building products that
            meet technical specifications and user requirements.
            Software development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining different software
            applications. It involves the application of various principles and techniques from computer science,
            engineering and mathematical analysis. Software development aims to create efficient, reliable, and easy-to-use
            software.
